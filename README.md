This repository demonstrates a common error involving unsafe raw pointers in Rust and its solution. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code that directly modifies a vector using a raw pointer. This approach is unsafe because it bypasses Rust's memory safety guarantees.  The `bugSolution.rs` file shows the safe approach using proper vector manipulation. Always prefer safe methods over unsafe ones unless absolutely necessary, ensuring memory safety and preventing potential crashes.
